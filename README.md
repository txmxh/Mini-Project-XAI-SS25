# Mini-Project-XAI-SS25
This project explores GNN explainability on RDF graphs using FastRGCN and three explanation methods: Captum, GraphLIME, and PGExplainer. Implemented in PyTorch Geometric and evaluated on the AIFB dataset, it provides node and edge-level insights through visual and quantitative analysis.
